# ETL-Project - BigDataEngineering
This project was a major part of a course I took - "Big Data Engineering" at TAU’s Faculty of Engineering, during the 3rd year of my studies (2025).

The project has been the 1st course assignment, focused on building a complete ETL pipeline for the Olist online orders dataset (Brazil). The task included:

- Performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, specifically handling null values, duplicates, and logical inconsistencies.

- Designing and constructing a data warehouse from scratch using a star schema, applying denormalization and design pattern principles.

The full details can be found in the notebook file (HTML) and in the [Final Report (PDF)](הנדסת נתוני עתק - מטלה 1 - קבוצה 2 - עידן כנת, אופק שהרבני ואושרי מנדלאווי - דוח מסכם - 31.5.2025.pdf), in the repo, written in **Hebrew**. 

The project's final grade - 93.
