# ETL-Project - BigDataEngineering
This project was a major part of a course I took - "Big Data Engineering" at TAUâ€™s Faculty of Engineering, during the 3rd year of my studies (2025).

The project has been the 1st course assignment, focused on building a complete ETL pipeline for the Olist online orders dataset (Brazil). The task included:

- Performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, specifically handling null values, duplicates, and logical inconsistencies.

- Designing and constructing a data warehouse from scratch using a star schema, applying denormalization and design pattern principles.

The full details can be found in the notebook file (HTML) and in the [Final Report (PDF)](https://github.com/IdanKanat/ETL-Project__BigDataEngineering/blob/11269086a00a294f73a22a4eef86829957f2d0bf/%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A1%D7%AA%20%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%A7%20-%20%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%94%201%20-%20%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%94%202%20-%20%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9F%20%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%AA%2C%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A7%20%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%95%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%20%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%20-%20%D7%93%D7%95%D7%97%20%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%9B%D7%9D%20-%2031.5.2025.pdf), in the repo, written in **Hebrew**. 

The project's final grade - 93.
