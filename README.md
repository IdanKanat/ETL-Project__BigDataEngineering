# ETL-Project - BigDataEngineering
This project was a major part of a course I took - "Big Data Engineering" at TAUâ€™s Faculty of Engineering, during the 3rd year of my studies (2025).

The project has been the 1st course assignment. Along with my 2 partners, we focused on building a complete ETL pipeline for the Olist online orders dataset (Brazil). The task included:

- Performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, specifically handling null values, duplicates, and logical inconsistencies.

- Designing and constructing a data warehouse from scratch using a star schema, applying denormalization and design pattern principles.

The project's final grade - 93.
